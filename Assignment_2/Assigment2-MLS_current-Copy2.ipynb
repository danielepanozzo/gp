    " * Compute an implicit MLS function approximating a 3D point cloud with given (but possibly unnormalized) normals.\n",
    " * Sample the implicit function on a 3D volumetric grid.\n",
    " * Apply the marching tets algorithm to extract a triangle mesh of this zero level set.\n",
    " * Experiment with various MLS reconstruction parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your main task is to construct an implicit function `f(x)` defined on all `x`  R<sup>3</sup> whose zero level set contains (or at least passes near) each input point. That is, for every point `pi` in the point cloud, we want `f(pi) = 0`. Furthermore, `∂f` (the isosurface normal) evaluated at each point cloud location should approximate the point's normal provided as input."
